Exponential or Exponential’s advertising partners may also download cookies and similar technologies such as pixel tags/beacons and scripts downloaded to your computer (‘cookies’) to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. Doing this allows them to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content.
