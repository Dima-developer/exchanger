        <h2>Cookie Policy</h2>
        <p>Effective as of May 25, 2018 (the "Effective Date").</p>
        <p>The Cookie Notice applies to cookies (as defined below) that are placed and read out on x-rates.com (the “Website”).</p>
        <div>
          <h3>What are cookies?</h3>
          <p>Cookies and similar technologies such as pixel tags/beacons and scripts (‘cookies’) are small data files which are downloaded onto your device by the website or mobile application which you are visiting. The next time you visit the same website, cookies ensure that your device is recognised. By using cookies, this website can save information about visits and visitors.</p>
          <p>As described below, we place some of the cookies on the Website or App ourselves, while other cookies are placed by third parties (such as our advertising services supplier, Exponential Interactive, Inc (“Exponential”) – see “Targeting Cookies”). Third-party cookies may collect data outside our Website and App as as well. Cookies cannot view or retrieve data from other cookies, nor can they capture files or data stored on your computer.</p>
          <p>Cookies can be utilised to make visiting a website more personal, by, for instance:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>displaying relevant navigation settings;</li>
            <li>remembering visitors’ preferences;</li>
            <li>improving the overall user experience;</li>
            <li>limiting the number of advertisements shown.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Generally, cookies can be disabled and the “help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. If you would like to use or access a website, you may do so without accepting all cookies. However, as described below, you should understand that if you choose not to accept cookies, some services that may be offered through a website may not function properly or optimally, you will not be permitted to access certain secured areas or there may be other effects on your browsing experience.</p>

          <h3>Use of cookies</h3>
          <p>The cookies placed and read out on the Website and App are categorised below.</p>
          <p>As “strictly necessary” cookies are required for the operation of the Website and App they are automatically enabled on the Website and App. For the other categories of cookies, the Website and App uses a cookie consent manager through which you can provide your opt-in consent to the relevant cookie category.</p>

          <div>Strictly necessary cookies</div>
          <p>Strictly necessary cookies are required for the operation of the Website or App and accordingly are automatically enabled. They are usually only set in response to actions you make on the Website or App, such as selecting privacy settings.</p>
          <p>These cookies do not remember where you’ve been on the internet or use or store any personally identifiable information.</p>
          <p>If you manually block or delete these types of cookies, sections of the Website or App will not function properly and XE may not be able to provide technical support / solutions to users of the Website.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div>Preference cookies</div>
          <p>If you have accepted these cookies through our cookie consent manager, preference cookies are set when you make preference settings changes on the Website or App and they allow for your changes to be saved for a tailored and better experience for you. These include settings such as showing the inverse currency conversion, language preference, and preferred currencies.</p>
          <p>These cookies do not remember where you’ve been on the internet or use or store any personally identifiable information.</p>
          <p>If you don’t opt-in to these cookies, you may experience inconsistent site behaviour, requiring you to make repetitive changes and the Website or App will behave as if it is your first time visit, every time you visit.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div>Analytics cookies</div>
          <p>If you have accepted these cookies through our cookie consent manager, analytics cookies help us offer you a better user experience, allow us to count visits and determine where users are coming from. These cookies help us make choices of how we improve the performance of our Website and App when we make changes and updates. They also let us know what pages and screens are popular and most useful for our users.</p>
          <p>The information collected by these cookies is aggregated, so we are not able to track or identify individual users.</p>
          <p>If you don’t opt-in to these cookies, the way you use our Website or App won’t be collected and it becomes more difficult for us to create aggregate reports and identify performance enhancements.</p>
